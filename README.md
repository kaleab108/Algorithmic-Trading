# Algorithmic-Trading
Using Jupyter Notebook on Anaconda, I have designed an algorithmic trading for AAPL and TSLA. In this section, 
I will implement an Algorithm Trading strategy known as the momentum strategy on stock price data using Python.
In the momentum strategy, we buy the stocks when the momentum is positive and sell the stocks when the momentum
is negative.
